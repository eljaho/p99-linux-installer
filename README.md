# P99-Linux-Installer
A small shell script that installs Project 1999 on Linux.

## Prerequisites
You need a torrent client, and you need a Debian based distro. I tested this using Linux Mint and it ran flawlessly.

### A Few Things To Note
Your game is likely going to crash the first time you try entering world. Just run the game again.

The 'EverQuest Project 1999' folder is in /home/$USER/ so just cd into that directory and run 'wine eqgame patchme'

To fix the sound and play the MIDI tracks you'll have to configure that manually through qsynth. See this wiki for additional information.
